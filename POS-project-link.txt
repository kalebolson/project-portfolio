Apart from the three smaller projects I have listed in this repo, 
I have one larger project I would like to share:

https://github.com/kalebolson/602POS-KNR


As this was a group effort, I am keeping information specific to myself within this file.
This is a POS system designed for a small scale supermarket. It stores data in .txt files
in an effort to keep information consistent when the program is terminated and run again.
It also utilizes a swing UI. 

The project directory itself is the 'POSSystem' directory, while other files pertaining to 
the project's development are stored in the '602POS-KNR' directory. 

I was tasked with writing most of the back end, while the rest of the team worked largely 
on the UI.

I personally wrote roughly 80% of the content in the following files (within /POSSystem/src/):
Store.java
Register.java
Cashier.java
Shift.java
Event.java

|END-USER INSTRUCTIONS:   |
|-------------------------|
In order to run this program, you'll need to run AppFrame.java (this contains the UI).
Log in with either of the following sets of credentials:
--------------------------------------------------
*ADMINISTRATOR*
ID: 0
Password: masterpassword
--------------------------------------------------
*CASHIER*
ID: 1
Password: asdf
--------------------------------------------------

The administrator menu is quite different from the cashier menu, so be sure to log in
with both profiles to see the whole program.
